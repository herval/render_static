== DESCRIPTION:

render_static allows you to make your single-page apps (Backbone, Angular, etc) built on Rails SEO-friendly. It works by injecting a small rack middleware that will render pages as plain html, when the requester has one of the following user-agent headers:

Googlebot
Googlebot-Mobile
AdsBot-Google
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Ask Jeeves/Teoma; +http://about.ask.com/en/docs/about/webmasters.shtml)
Baiduspider
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; bingbot/2.0; +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm)

Please note that, in order for this to work, you need more than one thread/process of your webserver running, as the middleware will effectively make a second call back to your own app and render the content, streaming it back to the requester (crawler/bot).


== TO DO/PROBLEMS:

* Caching support
* Support for other drivers
* Log what's going on

== INSTALL:

Add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem 'render_static'

In order to serve a set of routes as a single-page app, your routes.rb usually contains a catch-all route that will direct /* or /something/* to the same index.html file (the root of your js app). In order to allow the render_static middleware to intercept the right routes, you need to add this to your app initialization:

    config/initializers/render_static.rb

    RenderStatic::Middleware.base_path = "/" # replace / for whichever path matches your app's index.html
    RenderStatic::Middleware.seo_id    = "seo_id" # replace seo_id with whatever ID is used for the HTML DOM element which would be updated with status as "ready" once the ajax load is completed.

And you're done! The middleware will only try to static-render requests made by bots AND that would render application/html content.

You can test that everything is working as expected by CURLing:

    # this will render the usual blank slate client-side apps serve
    curl http://localhost:3000/some/backbone/route

    # this will render a static representation of your page (just like it would look like in a browser)
    curl -A "Googlebot" http://localhost:3000/some/backbone/route
